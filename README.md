Genshin Spin Simulator Bot
This is a Telegram bot that simulates spins (gacha pulls) from the popular game Genshin Impact. The bot allows users to simulate obtaining characters with varying rarities, keep track of their pulls, and interact with a fully functional gacha system.

üöÄ Features
Spin Simulation: Users can simulate spins and receive characters of different rarities.
Character Management: Track your character collection, including legendaries, epics, and more.
Banner Rotation: The bot automatically updates the current banner, ensuring that users can always pull from the most up-to-date banners.
History Tracking: Keep track of your pull history and banner participation.
Spin Relevance Check: Ensure banners are still valid and up-to-date within their time limits.
üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
Python: The bot is written in Python, leveraging its powerful asynchronous capabilities.
AIOgram 3: Asynchronous Telegram bot framework for Python that handles the communication between the bot and users.
SQLAlchemy: For database management and working with various models such as users, characters, and banners.
Asyncio: Efficient handling of asynchronous operations, making the bot fast and responsive.
PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQLite: The bot is compatible with different SQL databases.
